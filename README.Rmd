The goal of xldiff is to facilitate comparing excel sheets to look for changes, inspired by `diff` tools. `xldiff` was originally developed to help compare inputs and outputs for different runs of the FRAM salmon model, which stores both inputs and outputs in excel files. However, the comparison tools here can be used more broadly to compare different files with the same structure, for example monthly reports summarizing survey information, service use, or finances.

xldiff is part of the [FRAMverse R-Universe](https://framverse.r-universe.dev/packages)

## Installation

You can install the development version of xldiff from R-Universe like so:

``` r
install.packages("xldiff", repos = "https://framverse.r-universe.dev")
```

If you have Rtools and `{remotes}` or `{pak}` installed, you can install from source code like so:

```r
pak::pkg_install("cbedwards-dfw/xldiff")
#OR
remotes::install_github("cbedwards-dfw/xldiff")
```

To install the development version, which may include new features that have been added 
but not thoroughly tested:

```r
pak::pkg_install("cbedwards-dfw/xldiff@dev")

```


## Example

### Creating our files

We can carry out simple comparisons of excel files with the `excel_diff()` function. 
To begin with, we must have two excel sheets that are generally similar, but for which some cells have differing values.  To walk through our example, we first must create two such excel sheets. Here we use the first 20 rows of the `penguins` data in the `palmerpenguins` package (https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

```r
library(palmerpenguins)
library(writexl)

# create our two data frames
dat1 = dat2 = penguins[1:20,]
## convert $island to character for easier modification
dat1$island = dat2$island = as.character(dat1$island)
## change several entries in dat2.
dat2$island[10] = "Scotland"
dat2$body_mass_g[6] = 365
dat2$bill_depth_mm[20] = 25



## write to excel files, in sheet named "penguins". See ?writexl::writexlsx.
write_xlsx(list(penguins = dat1),
           path = "example-penguins-1.xlsx")
write_xlsx(list(penguins = dat2),
           path = "example-penguins-2.xlsx")
```

### Basic example

With our two files in hand, we can use `excel_diff` to compare them. We need to specify the two files
we are comparing, the name of the new file that will show the comparison, and the sheet we are comparing.

```r
library(xldiff)

excel_diff(file_1 = "example-penguins-1.xlsx",
          file_2 = "example-penguins-2.xlsx",
          results_name = "penguin-file-comparison.xlsx",
          sheet_name = "penguins"
)

```

This produces an excel file that shows and highlights changes in cells.

We can also run a diff that displays in the "Viewer" section of Rstudio by using
`excel_diff_table()`:

```r
excel_diff(file_1 = "example-penguins-1.xlsx",
          file_2 = "example-penguins-2.xlsx",
          sheet_name = "penguins"
)
```

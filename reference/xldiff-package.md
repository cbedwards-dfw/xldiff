# xldiff: Compare excel sheets

\`xldiff\` provides tools to compare excel sheets, broadly inspired by
"diff"-type functions. Provided functions can read sheets of two excel
files and produce a third file that highlights cells that have changed.
In the case of numeric changes, the direction of change is highlighted.
These tools do not account for structural changes in the sheets (e.g.,
the addition of a column), but are useful in tracking changed values in
tables or parameter files. Utility functions developed to streamline
formatting output files are also more broadly useful in programmatically
formatting excel files using openxlsx.
